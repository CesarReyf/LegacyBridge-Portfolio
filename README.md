# LegacyBridge-Portfolio

A collection of professional software projects showcasing experience across modern development (Python, C#, APIs, automation) as well as legacy and mainframe environments (COBOL, JCL, CICS, WFL, DMSII/DASDL).  
This portfolio highlights versatility across different technologies, with an emphasis on clean architectures, maintainability, and system modernization when applicable.

While part of my background includes work in banking and financial systems, these skills are presented here as an additional strength — not a limitation.  
I am fully open to roles in modern development environments, backend engineering, automation, and system integration.
